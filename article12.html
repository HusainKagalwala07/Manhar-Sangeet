music with his simple and yet effective vocalism, sweet and yet bold Taan patterns, complicated and
yet impressive Bandishes which almost mesmerized the entire audience in the whole of India. He
was none other than Guni Gandharva Pandit Lakshman Prasad Jaipurwale, a saint philosopher
vocalist of the Gusaien Gharana.Pandit Lakshman Prasad Jaipurwale was born on 15 th January 1915 at Dhrangadhra (Gujrat).
His father Pandit Baldev Prasad was court musician in the courts of Maharaj of Indore and Jaipur. He
was initiated in to the realms of traditional classical music by his father.Subsequently, Pandit
Lakshman Prasad had his advanced rigorous formal training under the tutelage of Goswami Guttu-
Gopal of (Kunwar Shyam) Gusaien Gharana. Panditji himself was a gifted child artist at that time that
was very much in demand during the music programs. By about 1950, Pandit Lakshman Prasad
emerged as a unique combination of rare musical repertoire, literary genius and spiritual veracity.</p>

                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came to Bombay during his early 1950 in search og greener pasture. During one of his
early performances itself, he established himself as one of the great artistes of Hindustani Classical
Singing by his unassuming approach to life, music and divinity. Music lovers who attended his
programs at C J Hall during fifties may very well recollect the impact of his singing, not only on the
audience, but also on the organizers and fellow artistes.</p>

                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandit Lakshman Prasad settled in Bombay since 1951 established himself as a true guru,
imparting the divine knowledge of music to a number of disciples, big and small, rich and poor. His
two illustrious sons Pandit Govind Prasad Jaipurwale (vocalist, died 1988) and Pandit Girdhar Prasad
Jaipurwale renowned percussionist and himself a composer of music, were trained by him in the art
of music. His grandson Pandit Bhavdeep is a full-fledged singer and composer.</p>

Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Amir Khan and Pandit Lakshman Parasad Jaipurwale. A point of intrest here
is that Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan had a sweet and soft voice in contrast to his physically big
personality. Ustad Amir Khan had a majestic personality and deep &amp; powerful voice. Pandit
Lakshman Prasad Jaipurwale was slim and had a penetrating and resilient voice. All 3 were
considered to be the great pillars of Hindustani Classical edifice.</p>
                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in 1956 that Pandit Lakshman Prasad Jaipurwale was invited to sing during the Har-
Vallabh Music Conference in Jalandhar. It was late night when he got his chance to sing. Panditji sat
on the platform and tuned his Tanpura. He had chosen Raag Jog-Bahar. Singing leisurely, he began to
expound beautifully every note of the raga, one by one in a melodious and pleasing manner. It is
well known that the audience at Jalandhar is a well knowledgeable one in Classical Music. All who
were present there were enthralled by Panditji’s performance. The voice’s sweetness and grace was
unique. The entire audience was spellbound. The authorities then conferred him with the title ”Guni
Gandharva” in appreciation and recognition of his divine way of presentation of classical heavenly
music with devout honesty and sincereity.</p>
                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since this incidence, Guni Gandharva Pandit Lakshman Prasad Jaipurwale was a regular
performer in almost all big music conferences in India including Sawai Gandharva of Pune. During
each of his performances, the effect of his music was invitingly sweet. The melody of his voice, the
rhythmic variation of his presentation, the devotional touch of the lyrics and the novel and simple
way of singing were the factors of his popularity. There was economy in his Dexter but there was
also sweetness and novelty.</p>
                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pandit Lakshman Prasad Jaipurwale lived a simple life. True his Gharana, which is considered
to be one of saints who have renounced all material comforts, he never bothered about his standard
of living. He was content with the minimum requirements and was very generous as a musician.
With his saintly approach to life, it may appear that he wasn’t really suited to live during those days,
when people were very much materialistic and commercial. Panditji used to say that music is the
only link with the Almighty. There is a curtain hiding His vision from us. This curtain is nothing but
our ego, pride, jealousy, greed and ignorance. Music, which is divine, will help us to remove this
curtain and enjoy fruits of life.

in this world, though he is not physically present. It lives in the minds of those who have heard him.
Often his recorded music is broadcast from All India Radio.</p>
                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A book titled “Sangeet Gyan Prakash” containing his rare compositions is published by his
