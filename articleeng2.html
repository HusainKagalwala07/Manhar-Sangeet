interview of Shyamrang by Omprakash (Allahabad, 2 February 1993)</b></font></p>

                            <br><p align="justify"><b>Q: Which gharana do you belong to?</b><br>
A: Gusai Gharana which is also known as ‘Kunwar Shyam Gharana’.</p>

                            <p align="justify"><b>Q: It is not a famous gharana, is it?</b><br>
A: We are all ascetics, we believe only in devotion towards music. Never ever
there was a question of gaining fame and limelight through music neither we
thought of setting up an institution for the very purpose. They simply performed
music whole-heartedly and getting completely immersed into ‘Sadhana’ hence,
this gharana remained away from main-stream gharanas.</p>

                            <p align="justify"><b>Q: What are the attributes of Gusai gharana and which are the famous and
often rendered Ragas of your gharana?</b><br>
A: In our gharana we emphasize more on ‘meendh’ which is a voice modulation
technique in Hindustani Classical Music as well as the practice of
‘Merukhandh’ which is often used with emotional shade. Our Bandhish
(compositions) are specialities of our gharana which are in the rhythmical form
which has a dance like elegance. There are strong possibilities of missing the
control on the raga or losing the musical track while emphasizing on the
emotions but we have the ability to maintain importance of swaras. ‘Meendh’ is
the underlying current or the most fundamental teaching of our gharana.
Kunwar Shyamji had composed more compositions in ‘Malhar’ and ‘Kanada’
Ang maybe because they were his favourite. He had also composed many
bandish in Dhrupad and Dhamar which are mostly in common ragas like
Yaman, Bageshree, Bihag, Kaafi, Des etc. In our gharana we don’t practice
more in Mandra Laya (slow tempo), because practicing more of Mandra can
lead to deterioration of the beauty of the musical notes as well as the vocalist
need to put more efforts to produce sound form vocal chords. Also some
techniques of our gharana require a specific type of vocal training to be able to
sing complex musical patterns with ease.</p>

                            <p align="justify"><b>Q: Your Father is a well known Musicologist, so were you into music from
your childhood?</b><br>

A: I used to listen to him even tried to sing like him but was never completely
into music. Although I didn’t love music too much, I had a deep reverence for it
because it was my father’s profession. Once I had a chance to listen to his
Darbari and was moved by his rendition. I completely lost into it and started
listening it with more attention and his Darabari took over me and from that day
I started to listen more and more of his music and other ragas.</p>
                            <p align="justify"><b>Q: Do you sing only ‘Khayal’ or you like to perform ‘Thumri’ as well?</b><br>
A: In our tradition we do perform Dhrupad, Dhamar, Khayal, thumri , all form
of music. Kunwar Shyamji had composed many dhrupad bandish but he had
also composed many tumris. Hence, his name was counted among the thumri
composers. He used to present a thumri like a Khayal and could easily blend the
two into each other beautifying either of the forms. I personally like to sing
Khayal and not much inclined towards semi-classical forms like Thumri
because it’s a different form of music but I know how to sing a thumri.</p>

feel when you are not able to get enough of hands on practice?</b><br>
A: I study music daily for about 3-4 hrs but if due to some unavoidable
circumstances I’m not able to do so then for whole day my mood is down many
a times I remain frustrated throughout the day.</p>
                            <p align="justify"><b>Q: What is the significance of gharana system in Hindustani Classical
Music?</b><br>
A: Discipline is the first step for the development and one learns discipline in
the gharana. Teachings of our Gurus and Ustad are like sacred hymns for us.
We believe in them and follow the path shown by our teachers and while
following them we find our own. One can develop his or her own style and can
take liberty to make amendments in them and which do happen over time. One
gharana definitely help one musician to inculcate all the basic fundamentals and
discipline of the musical art form which is required for a performer to leave a
long lasting impact on listeners. In this process of developing a Gharana, one
automatically adds to the beauty of the music in totality. </p>
