Music with the form of “Khayal” and soulful ragas like Jaunpuri. A small
village named Surtaanpur of Jaunpur district, was the birthplace of Pt. Rajaram
Shukla in the year 1925. Since from the childhood Rajaram used to listen to the
musicians of those times. Those great Maifals of various ragas like Pilu,
Khamaj, Kafi etc sowed the seeds of music in his heart. His melodious voice
would undoubtedly attract applauds from the connoisseurs.</p>

                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amidst of this, he
lost his mother and three brothers in an epidemic. Though his father was also a
music lover but those times were not so conducive for artists like today so he
wished his children should take academic educations and not become
musicians. Panditji had a deep desire for learning music so there aroused a
dispute between father and son as they failed to realise mutual understanding
and finally young Rajaram left home for Ahyodhya.Pt. Bhagvat Kishor Vyakul was a harmonium Maestro then. He was
honoured with great titles by Rulers of different kingdoms and many Princely
States which existed back then in British India. Young Rajaram started taking
musical lessons from Pt. Bhagvat Vyakul. He came to know about the dispute
between Rajaram and his father so he himself went to his native place and
presented a musical program in the village. In spite of getting influenced from
his performance, father did not venture to change his decision. Vyakulji tried his
best to solve the ambiguities between the father and son and finally his father
accepted Rajaram as a musician.</p>

                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kunwar Shripal Singh was the prince of Singramau, a small princely
town in Jaunpur. He was music lover and could also sing very beautifully. At
every festive occasion a large crowd of artist would gather at his palace. On one
such occasion along with his guru, Vyakulji, Rajaramji were invited to perform.
Prince was completely delighted with his performance and asked Rajaram to
stay at his place. From the very next day he was appointed as the lecturer /
professor of music in Raja Harpal Singh College. Despite of having every
possible facility one artist could get he was not content and very uncomfortable
in the environment so he finally left this job.</p>

                            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roamed along the streets of Mumbai in search of himself, his music,
his ‘swara’ which ended soon and he eventually established himself. All India

Radio, Mumbai Doordarshan would play him on air. Meanwhile, he got
acquainted with Pt. Shyam Prasad Jaipurwale. He was a stalwart representative
of Gusai tradition of Hindustani classical music. Pt. Rajaram became disciple of
Pt. Shyam Prasad and continued to learn music from him. Rajaram’s ability to
hit the note or swara with ease and a gentle flow in his voice enabled his
mastery over music. Voice modulation techniques, such as ‘Meend’ and
‘Gamaks’ would come out through his vocal chords with a great ease and subtle
endurance. He made a remarkable contribution to the Hindustani Classical
Music by composing more than 400 ‘Bandish’ (Musical compositions). All of
his compositions were composed with a beautiful amalgamation of soulful
words ingeniously crafted with the suitable ragas which culminated into the
aesthetics of emotions or ‘bhava’. Pt. Rajaram Shukla was also a great guru,
some of his senior disciples were Pt. Murli Manohar Shukla, Shri. Kalki
Maharaj, Shrinivas Baal, Shri. G G Upadhyay, Shri Rjanedra Javeri, Smt.
Kunda Kulkarni, Smt. Jayshree Chaugule, Shri. Rajkumar Singh, Shri. Pramod
Chokshi, Shri. Vijay Singh, Shri. Ramashankar Tripathi and many more.</p>
